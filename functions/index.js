/**
 * This file is the default entry point for Firebase Functions if not using TypeScript
 * or if the package.json "main" field points here.
 * Since this project uses TypeScript with an entry point at functions/src/index.ts
 * (which compiles to functions/lib/index.js), this root index.js file is
 * generally not used for deploying the primary functions and can be cleaned up
 * to avoid linting errors from unused template code.
 *
 * Make sure your functions/package.json "main" field points to "lib/index.js".

// This file itself doesn't need to export anything if "main" in package.json is "lib/index.js".
